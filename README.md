# React Game of Life

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Intro

This is a React-based implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life),
a zero-player grid-based game, which is to say, the play of the game proceeds without input after the initial
setup.

I built this to learn some React by playing with it. Game of Life is one of my favorite
aids to learning a new language/tool/framework.

## Running

Install dependencies using:

`npm install`

Run with:

`npm start`

## Play

- A board with a random distribution of alive/dead cells will be created.
- Speed of the game can be controlled with the slider.
- Get a new board by clicking refresh
